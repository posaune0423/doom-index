## 1. Motivation

Markets are emotional. Behind every price movement lives fear, hope, greed, anxiety, euphoria—the full spectrum of human feeling compressed into numbers.

But emotions are invisible. Charts show lines, not sentiment. Prices capture transactions, not psychology.

**What if we could make financial emotions visible?**

Generative AI can translate data into forms humans perceive. Language becomes images. Numbers become narratives. So why not translate market psychology into paintings?

Solana's memecoin markets—where rationality and irrationality collide at light speed—are the purest expression of collective financial emotion. Every buy is hope. Every sell is doubt. Every spike is euphoria, every crash is panic.

DOOM INDEX was born to **archive these emotions**—transforming raw market data into paintings that capture what the numbers alone never could: how the market _felt_ at that exact moment.

---

## 2. What DOOM INDEX Is

**DOOM INDEX is a decentralized archive of financial emotions—an onchain system where AI generates one painting every minute, translating the collective psychology of 8 pump.fun tokens into visual art.**

These 8 tokens—launched on pump.fun, the Solana memecoin launchpad—represent fundamental human concerns: environmental collapse, existential threats, technological dominance, fear, and hope. As their market caps shift, the emotions they represent flow into the painting. When FEAR rises, shadows deepen. When HOPE climbs, light breaks through. When NUKE spikes, the canvas erupts in radioactive glow.

**Market emotion becomes visual emotion.** Every painting is a timestamp of collective psychology—a permanent record of how thousands of traders felt at that exact moment in time.

### v1 → v2 Evolution

**v1 (Current)** is the proof of concept—fixed 8 tokens, fully automated generation, one new painting every minute. It demonstrates that markets can become art.

**v2 (Coming Soon)** introduces community governance and historical archiving. Through **DOOM DAO**, $DOOM holders will vote on which tokens matter. **Season NFTs** will preserve historically significant moments chosen by the community. A **Dynamic Index** will allow adding trending tokens and removing outdated ones.

---

## 3. How the Painting Is Generated

Every minute, the system captures the 8 tokens' market caps and translates them into a painting through a weighted composition algorithm:

![Painting generation pipeline](/diagrams/painting-pipeline.svg)

### The Algorithm

**1. Relative Dominance Calculation**
The token with the highest market cap becomes the reference point. All other tokens are weighted relative to this dominant token—not to fixed thresholds. This means the painting always reflects _which forces are stronger than others_ at that moment.

**2. Non-Linear Emphasis**
A power function amplifies differences. If FEAR is 2x higher than HOPE, the visual weight difference becomes even more pronounced. This makes dominant emotions clearly visible in the composition.

**3. Weighted Medieval Allegory**
Each token maps to a visual motif—"dense toxic smog" (CO2), "radiant golden light" (HOPE), "nuclear flash" (NUKE). The AI receives a weighted prompt in the format `(element:weight)`, creating a medieval allegorical oil painting where visual presence directly reflects market dominance.

**4. Deterministic Output**
Same market state = same painting. The system uses a hash of the rounded market caps to skip regeneration when nothing significant has changed, ensuring consistency.

### AI as Interpreter

> _"There are no facts, only interpretations."_
> — Friedrich Nietzsche

DOOM INDEX doesn't show you "the truth" about markets—it shows you an **interpretation**.

Charts display numbers. Prices show transactions. These are valuable, but they're one way to see markets. DOOM INDEX offers another: **emotional translation**. The AI doesn't analyze or predict. It translates market psychology into visual language, the same way a poet translates feelings into words.

When AI interprets market data through symbolic mapping (CO2 → fog, HOPE → light), you experience the market from a different angle—not as data, but as **atmosphere**.

---

## 4. The Eight Tokens

These 8 tokens form the "world model" of DOOM INDEX. When their market cap rises, specific elements in the painting strengthen. When they fall, those elements weaken.

## 5. Future Plans: v2 & Beyond

### Where We're Going

v1 proves the concept: markets can be art. But there's room to evolve. The current fixed tokens could adapt to new memes or cultural shifts. Right now, every painting disappears after a minute—no memory exists. And the community has no voice in what matters.

**v2 will introduce DOOM DAO and Season NFTs** to address these limitations.

### DOOM DAO: Community Governance (Coming Soon)

Holding **$DOOM** tokens grants governance power over three key areas:

**1. Index Composition** — Decide which tokens influence the painting. Should a trending meme token be added? Is it time to remove something outdated? The community votes.

**2. Historical Curation** — Every season (~30-90 days), the DAO votes on which moments to preserve. "Best DOOM" captures the most apocalyptic painting, "Least DOOM" the most hopeful. These will be immortalized as NFTs.

**3. Model Evolution** — Should DOOM INDEX train a custom art style? Which visual direction should it explore? The community decides the aesthetic future.

### Season NFTs: Preserving History

Right now, every painting lasts 1 minute and vanishes. But some moments are too important to lose—**market crashes** that send FEAR to the moon, **unexpected HOPE surges** during chaos, **meme events** that make MACHINE or PANDEMIC explode.

The system will log every painting with full market data. The community nominates historically significant moments, and the DAO votes on which matter most. Winners get regenerated in ultra-high resolution (4K-8K) and minted as permanent NFTs on Solana.

Each NFT becomes a **timestamp of collective psychology**—proof that on a specific date, the market felt a certain way and looked like this.

### Why $DOOM Will Have Value

**$DOOM = The right to curate internet capital market history**

The value of DOOM INDEX doesn't come from hype—it comes from a structural intersection of **AI × Art × Collective Memory**.

Here's why this matters:

#### 1. AI Evolution = Permanent Art Value Increase

DOOM INDEX paintings aren't static—they evolve with AI technology itself. Better AI models produce better paintings from the same market data. Prompt algorithms continuously improve. Season NFTs become **cultural snapshots of AI capability at that moment**.

**As AI gets better, the archive gets more valuable.** Since NFTs don't degrade, this "continuous quality increase" creates long-term value for the entire archive.

#### 2. Community as Market Memory Editors

One painting every minute equals infinite generation, but only a few moments get preserved. $DOOM holders decide which moments to immortalize as NFTs, which tokens should enter the index, which direction the visual style evolves, and ultimately what history gets written.

**$DOOM = Editorial rights to market history.** As Season NFTs accumulate, these editorial rights gain compounding cultural and economic value.

#### 3. The Art × Meme Crossroads

DOOM INDEX isn't just art. It's not just memecoin. It's where **market volatility becomes emotion**. Meme market volatility translates into painting emotion. CO2, NUKE, and HOPE function as culturally intuitive symbols. Every screenshot shared on X creates self-propagating presence.

In crypto culture, strong context creates art value while strong memes create crypto vあalue. DOOM INDEX has both. It sits at the rare intersection where **cultural capital meets meme capital**.

---

**In Summary**, $DOOM value is built on three reinforcing layers: AI progress lifts archive quality forever, DAO curation creates scarcity from infinity, and the Art × Meme position captures maximum cultural attention. This isn't just price—it's the infrastructure for **markets recording their own history**.
